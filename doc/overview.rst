Overview
========

**WESTpy** is designed to assist users of the **WEST** code in pre- and post-processing operations.

Features:

   - Guided generation of input files for ground state density functional theory calculations (Qbox, Quantum ESPRESSO)
   - Guided generation of input files for WEST
   - Plot of density of states (DOS), local density of states (LDOS), full-frequency self-energy, and optical absorption spectrum
   - Diagonalization of quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) Hamiltonian
   - Excited state geometry relaxation using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) forces
